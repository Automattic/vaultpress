# 2.0

## Dashboard

This version of VaultPress will come with a brand new dashboard, with a new design.

- Try testing how the dashboard looks like on a site where Jetpack is installed, and where Jetpack is not installed.
- Try viewing the dashboard on a new site, that has not been set up yet.
- Try viewing the dashboard on an existing site.
- Try accessing the dashboard on different browsers and different devices.

## General

This version of VaultPress will require PHP 5.3. If possible, try to install the plugin on a site running an older version of PHP. The plugin should not load, and you should see a notice inviting you to upgrade to a newer version of PHP instead.

### Others

- If you have the opportunity to test in an older browser like IE11, please do so. You may catch some interesting bugs!
- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticible and report anything you see.

**Thank you for all your help!**
